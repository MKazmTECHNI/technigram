# Placeholder Technigram's README

Im too lazy to actually make a finalized readme, so theres that, also the project isnt finalized either

THE PROJECT IS UNFINISHED, there are things like post matching algorithm to be done (somehow), permissions/roles, places like "school announcements" and just giving spirit so it's not another Twitter.

THE DATABASE PROVIDED IS JUST AN EXAMPLE. I leave it mostly so I have working one in version control, cuz im switching from pc to laptop dynamically, and want to have it in version control.

## Q&A

"U using express? Dumbass ew ew ew ew"

- Yes, I'm not going to be adding 2 hours to my worktime, just so i have 3% speed increase, and so it can work fluently with 210 000 users insead of 21 999 at the same time. Not more than 10 ppl are probably gonna use it in same time anyways, and platform is not in plans of holding over 500 ppl.

That was the only question I remember rn, you can torture me with more ig.

### Again its a placeholder, so no tutorial how to download source files and reuse it.

# MOST IMPORTANT TO DO:

- REWRITE LOGINING IN SO THERE'S NO SHORT KICK TO BACKEND SERVER, cuz it's http, making flow stop and declining login.
